# GPT3 Discord Bot
 Host your own GPT-3 Discord bot
 
 i'd host and make the bot invitable myself, however GPT3 terms of service prohibit public use of GPT3 without aproval and the tokens used in large quantities will get expensive.
 
 # Instructions
 
 1. ```pip requirements.txt```
 2. paste in your GPT-3 key into ApiKey.txt
 3. paste in the key for the discord bot into BotKey.txt
 4. run the script
